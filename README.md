# Advice-Insights
##**Project Overview**
This code is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that uses the `Gradio` library to analyze customer reviews and ratings for a service. It leverages Google's Generative AI model (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) to generate intelligent analysis, including:
- **Main issues** mentioned by customers.
- **Success rate** of the service based on ratings.
- **Actionable advice** for improving the service.

The application supports both English and Arabic languages, making it versatile for different audiences.
